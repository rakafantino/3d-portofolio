# 3D Portfolio

This is a 3D portfolio built using React, Three.js, and other various libraries. It is a personal project to showcase my skills and experiences in a unique and interactive way.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, first make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

Copy code

    git clone https://github.com/rakafantino/3d-portofolio.git

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

Copy code

    cd 3d_portofolio

3.  Install the dependencies:

Copy code

    npm install

4.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

Copy code

    VITE_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID= "your_emailjs_service_id"
    VITE_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID="your_emailjs_template_id"
    VITE_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY= "your_emailjs_public_key"

you can get `service_id`,`template_id`, and `public_key` by registering on this webisite [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)

5.  Start the development server:

Copy code

    npm run dev

6.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to view the portfolio.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
